# Get Smart With Me
Digital Flashcards

Technical stack: React, Redux, Express, PassportJS, and MongoDB 

When I study flashcards, I have four piles: 
1. Cards that I haven't viewed yet 
2. Cards that I nailed 
3. Cards that I got so-so 
4. Cards for which I have no idea or for which I was completely wrong 

After each round, I collect piles 3 ("so-so" cards) and 4 ("totally off" cards) and work through this new stack. I repeat this until all cards make it to pile 2 ("nailed it" pile). 

This app enables users to study flashcards using this method. I've long relied on this method to study flashcards, and it has served me well. 



Build plan: 
1. Construct backend and server

    a. Make a login/registration router (which I call "welcome") 

    b. Configure PassportJS to handle authentication

    b. Make a home page router (which I call "home") 

    c. Make deck router 

    d. Make study session router 
  
2. Construct frontend

    a. Create actions, action creators, and reducers

    b. Connect this to the backend 

    c. Create presentational components 

    d. Create container components
    
3. Baseline functionality achieved: test, fix, and iterate 
4. Refactor code 
5. Style front-end components 
6. Add functionality 
  
  - Some ideas: stats on indiviudal sessions to track progress, make decks sharable between users, add animations
